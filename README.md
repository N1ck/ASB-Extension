**NOTE: ASB has "attempted" to implement a similiar method to allow for copy-pasting of bank account numbers. It sucks, and unfortunately this extension won't override theirs currently.**

##ASB Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to make the ASB Fastnet experience a bit better.


###Install from source

Using Google Chrome:
* [Download the project archive](https://github.com/N1ck/ASB-Extension/archive/master.zip) and extract it somewhere.
* Click on Tools -> Settings -> Extensions
* Select "Enable developer mode" in the upper right of the window.
* Click on "Load unpacked extension".
* Select the extracted folder.



###TODO
  - Think of a better name for the extension.
  - Make a Logo
